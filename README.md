- by clicking the "Add" button, a default Algorithm.Job object 
will be created. 

- the "Save" button is used to save the changes 
made to the details of the Algorithm.Job.

- you can delete the Algorithm.Job by clicking 
the "Delete" button.

- after choosing the algorithm and having 
the job details all set, click "Run" to solve 
and compute for the turnaround time and
waiting time. A gantt chart will also be 
displayed at the top.
